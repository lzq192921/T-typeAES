# Quantum Circuit Implement of AES
We provides T-aes in the programming language Q# and depends on the Microsoft [Quantum Development Kit](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/development-kit), the code can be used to obtain quantum resource estimates of our T-type AES. 

In addition, our W-type S-box in the programming language Qiskit is provided  to verify the correctness of our W-type S-box.
